Data Type Introduction
"""

"""
Data type is just a classification of a single data, what kind of data we are passing in a program.

Types of Data types
Number system
    - Int --> They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.
    - Float --> Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the 
    integer and fractional parts. 
    - Complex --> are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats 
                    5+4j  
                    5 â€“real no.
                    4   imaginary no.
                    and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the
                    number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.

Boolean
    - True & False
String --> Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in 
            quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a 
            value to a variable. 
            - "A", "B", "C"
            the single character is called a data type
