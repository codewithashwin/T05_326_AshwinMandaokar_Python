Conditional Statements
"""

"""
what is conditional statements? why we use conditional statements or decision-making?
using conditional statement we change the flow of the program. if the conditions is True
perform this block of code else perform that block of code.(anticipation of code)
conditional statement generally use it for taking decision based on conditions.

Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken
according to the conditions.
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce True or False as outcome. You need to determine which 
action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

syntax:
if something is True:
    Do something
else:
    Do something

There are two types of value
0 = value
None = not applicable (the absence of value)

types of conditionals statement
1. if statement = if you have just only one condition for check, just use single statement.
2. if else statement = if you have more than one condition then use if else condition
3. if elif else : if you have more than two conditions then use if elif else
EX if some condition:
    Do something
elif some condition:
    Do something
else:
    Do something
    
    
4. nested if : condition inside condition
EX if condition:
        if condition:
            Do something
        else:
            Do something
    else:
        Do something


non-zero and not-None values as True, and if it is either
zero or None, then it is assumed as False value.

in if conditions we can use every type of operators.
