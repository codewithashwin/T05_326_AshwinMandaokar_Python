Introduction about Python

* what is python?
--> Python is an high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, general purpose programming language.
general purpose means there is a variety of use cases with python like python used in web-development, machine-learning,
data-science, GUI(graphical user interface) and mobile app development as well

it was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991, now currently the python software foundation handle the all development of 
python.

python had two major releases: i) python 2.x ii) python 3.x, these are the breaking changes.

* Installing python?
--> for working with python you have to install the Python interpreter, what is an interpreter? interpreter is just an 
program that helps to translate the source code into the machine understandable code(binary code), python.org is the website 
where we can download the python interpreter, current version is 3.10.6

* lets print the Hello world in python

print("Hello world")

output:
Hello world

its a print function in python that help to print the statement in the console
if you compare with other language it is one of the shortest syntax that python have

Hello world in java:

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  	System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
  }
  
}

* Why python so popular nowadays?
one of the major reason is its syntax
and followed by:
    b. mature and supportive python community.
    c. backed by renowned sponsor (google adopt python 2006, facebook and amazon).
    d. hundred of python libraries.
    e. versatility, efficiency, reliability and speed.
    f. big data, machine learning and cloud computing.
    g. first choice language.
    h. automation.
    
* Features of python
- i.  easy to lean,
   --> the syntax is seems like a plain english, so that's why its syntax is easy
  ii. easy to maintain
   --> python provides modularity means we can divide problems into a sub problems
   that way we can maintain code base easily
  
  iii.interpreted
   --> python is an interpreted programming language because the code will be executed by line by line
   
  iv. large & extensive library
  
  v. dynamically typed
   --> dynamically typed means In Python , No need to declare the data type. whereas in java or c we have to declare the
    data type. Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile-time, while dynamically-typed languages 
    perform type checking at run-time. Statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your 
    variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.


* Advantages and Disadvantages
 advantages --> advantages its like a features i directly jump into the disadvantages
 Disadvantages -->  
 a. its not good for memory intensive task
 b. execution speed is slow compared to c, c++
 
* Interpreted vs Compiled programming languages. Explain in detail imp..
- "Every program is a set of instructions, whether itâ€™s to add two numbers or send a request over the internet.
 Compilers and interpreters take human-readable code and convert it to computer-readable machine code."
- In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language,
the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, 
reads and executes the code.
 
* .py vs .pyc files 
- Python compiles the .py files and save it as .pyc file
- The .pyc contain the compiled bytecode of Python source files,A .pyc is not created for your main program file 
that you execute (only for imported modules).
- The .pyc file contains encoded python bytecode.

* How compilation will happen internally. Explain in detail 
-  The source code in python is saved as a . py file which is then compiled into a format known as byte code, 
byte code is then converted to machine code. After the compilation, the code is stored in . pyc files and is regenerated
when the source is updated.

* Different ways to write python program.
 --> Interactive = provides programmers with a quick way to execute commands and try out or test code without creating a
                    file., 
     IDLE = integrated development and learning environment, 
            CommandPrompt, 
     IDE = integrated development environment
